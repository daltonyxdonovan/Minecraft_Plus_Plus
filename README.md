modpack for minecraft bedrock for my children, spouse, and i

## how to use
currently it's still being made, as i've just learned how to do this, so the rp folder needs to be in 

C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_resource_packs

and the bp folder needs to be in

C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs

in the windows app version, for the rest i'm not sure yet. working on getting minecraft partner status to make it more accessible
